SIMPLE BANK ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN C 🏦

💡 OVERVIEW

This is a basic, command-line interface (CLI) application developed in C to simulate fundamental banking operations. It is designed to demonstrate the use of C structures (struct) for data management, arrays for storing multiple records, and functions for modularizing different application tasks.

•	Deposit (3) 💰: Adds a specified amount of money to an existing account.
•	Withdraw (4) 💸: Deducts an amount from an existing account, with a crucial check for Insufficient Balance to prevent negative balances.
•	Exit (5) 🚪: Terminates the program.
•	Data Structure: Utilizes an Account struct to manage data: account_number (int), name (char[50]), and balance (float).

🛠️ TECHNOLOGY USED

•	Language: C
•	Environment: Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h)
